# Beatsaber Downgrader

## Why?
Couldn't find any working ones and got too lazy to downgrade manually

## How to use?
- Run
- Enter Beatsaber Install Dir
- Select version to Install
- Enter Steam Username and Password
- Press ```Downgrade!``` and Wait

## How does it work?
It downloads the list of versions from the [BS_Downgrader_meta](https://github.com/RedstoneLP2/BS_Downgrader_meta) Github repo, then Downloads the selected version, Backs up the existing Install and copies the downloaded version over the existing one. 
Due to this, things likely WILL break.
